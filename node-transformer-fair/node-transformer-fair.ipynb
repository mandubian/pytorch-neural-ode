    "Once upon a time, there was a guy who decided to give life to a creature, half-Transformer, half-Neural-ODE. That seemed a cool idea at first sight but it revealed to be a monster, not so cute, always hungry to swallow all the single GPU power without beating any SOTA. Yet, along his misadventures, he met Prince Serendip and discovered many interesting knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this _tale of the NODE-Transformer_, you will know more about those weird creatures, the Transformer and the Neural-ODE and you will see how they were hybridized in a very foolish way. You will discover the narrow link between mathematical complexity and knowledge complexity and how it is naturally managed by the ODE-Solver in NODE-Transformer. You will then see how NODE-Transformer encoder seems to learn knowledge keeping a stable complexity while decoder builds more and more complex knowledge to fulfill the output task. Yet, NODE-Transformer appears to be much less performant than a classic Transformer, even with 1-layer of encoder/decoder. Searching for possible causes, you will learn that Neural-ODE can't represent all kind of functions but can be augmented to overcome those limitations. Then, despite augmented ODE, despite reduced scope to decoder only and finally a few tricks of optimization and regularization, NODE-Transformer never reaches classic Transformer's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, despite this creature might not be as nice as he expected, you will understand why the guy above was still liking his ugly creature and convinced it was worth the efforts.\n",

    "To give some intuition, in a 5-layers residual network sharing weights on all layers (see following figure), backpropagation is performed on 5 fixed steps `[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]` in interval `[0.0, 1.0]` from the output layer back to the input layer.\n",

    "- absolute error tolerance (ATOL)\n",
    "- relative error tolerance (RTOL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going too deep in mathematics, let say that in ODE solver deriving from Runge-Kutta method, an approximation of the max error between ground-truth value and estimated value can be computed. So, it's possible to fix a max error tolerance that allows the ODE Solver to know whether the estimated value is a viable solution. This description of both parameters gives some more intuition: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/troubleshoot-common-ode-problems.html#bu8pzr7\n",
    "\n",
    "DOPRI5 is an adaptive explicit ODE Solver. It means that, if it can't reach a low-enough error approximation, the solver can _refine the sampling steps_ until it finds an acceptable value. The more it refines the steps, the more the ODE Solver calls the neural model function until it finds an acceptable solution depending on the error tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous training session, ATOL/RTOL were fixed to 0.001 meaning \"roughly\" that it can't be more precise than 3 digits. It took 1.5 day to train with this error tolerance on a 1080-TI GPU. Lower ATOL/RTOL would have been a good test but it's not decent with current computing power (specially this summer in France where it has been >40°C). That's why it was decided to increase ATOL/RTOL to 0.01 and check what happens.\n",

Yet, it's interesting to remark that it reached this local minimum in a bit more than 4h compared to the previous 35h. So, it demonstrates that a bigger error tolerance truly leads to faster ODE Solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's observe the number of calls made by the ODE Solver to the neural networks in both encoder and decoder during the training:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NODE-Transformer Decoder ODE Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../media/transformer_full_lower_atol_nfe_decoder.svg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see here that the number of calls increases progressively with high peak values and becomes noisier when the NODE-Transformer saturates and doesn't optimize anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "This progressive increase of calls could mean the ODE Solver is exploring a relatively \"simple\" loss landscape at beginning of training. We can imagine knowledge that is learnt at first is basic in general. We can make an analogy with a human-crafted NLP pipeline. At first, you do basic structural tasks: tag words, lemmatize tags, find dependencies between lemma etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the ODE Solver is encountering more complex loss landscape and needs to sample its surroundings finer and finer to evaluate viable values. This corresponds to the increasing complexity of knowledge that is learnt during training: from basic language forms, it needs to model syntax and semantics, contextualize and build relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it's really interesting to validate this intuition that a Neural-ODE is truly increasing its own complexity dynamically to accomodate to the increasing knowledge complexity along training. But it's not just like a Resnet increasing arbitrarily its depth, the ODE-solver is naturally refining its computations depending on the complexity of the loss landscape it's exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**A bit of philosophy: this idea is mind-blowing as the optimization mechanism is effectivey forcing the ODE-Solver to increase its own complexity to solve more complex equations and at same time, optimizing requires to model more and more complex knowledge to learn the task. is it mathematical complexity driving knowledge complexity or knowledge complexity driving mathematical complexity? More like chicken and egg maybe ;)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---- \n",
    "It also proves we still need to work a lot to understand and study optimizers more and more. Let's remark that no paper proved anything about those aspects, theoretically speaking so it's still experimental hypothesis for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peak values are interesting too. It means there are batches which contain much more complicated information to represent and the ODE-Solver has hard time to estimate a value for that. Those very peaky values are also an issue for Neural-ODE trainings as one single batch can end in a very long duration of computation or even end in never-ending computations. This is an issue in current Neural-ODE as some trainings might never end if it can't solve a single batch as it never reaches a viable estimation. Maybe we could consider skipping those too complex batches and re-focus on them later when ODE-Solver can digest a higher complexity. To be studied in next version...\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../media/transformer_full_lower_atol_nfe_encoder.svg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really interesting: the encoder here learns almost in constant number of calls, except a few peak values (corresponding to batches of validation datasets between epochs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the NODE-Transformer decoder above increased the number of calls during training and the intuition is that it is building more and more complex knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would require an in-depth study in itself but we can suggest that encoding task might be a quite \"brute-force\" and systematic mechanism, a bit like extracting and storing all information about data in a database: the items, the lemma, even the basic relations like ordering or context. But it's raw information, it doesn't really contain complex knowledge and it doesn't really care about the final task to learn. Meanwhile, the decoder knows the final task to learn and has the responsibility to use that encoded raw information and model the fine relations between entities. Thus, it naturally models more and more complex knowledge.\n",

But it is not able to reach the same level of performance as the classic Transformer 1-layer decoder with residual connection pipeline.

So if the ODE Solver calls our network with same value at time-step `t1=0.1` and time-step `t2=0.9`, it will return the same result.

Meanwhile in the training without weight decay, the number of calls grows constantly and goes over the one without weight decay.\n",
